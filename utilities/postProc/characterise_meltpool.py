Purpose:
  Postprocessing script for finished simulation cases using ParaView 
  (pvpython):
  - Performs a mesh-aware continuity check of the single track.
  - If the track is continuous, computes per cross-section metrics:
    W (width), H (track height), H_depth (depth), and Porosity.

Assumptions:
  - ParaView (with pvpython) is installed and accessible in PATH.
  - Case outputs are compatible with laserbeamFoam (OpenFOAM v2412).
  - The computational mesh is regular and its spacing is known, allowing 
  expected cross-sections along the track to be enumerated.
  - Within each cross-section, cell volumes are uniform (or accounted for), so 
  that porosity computed from cell counts is equivalent to volume fraction.

Method:
  1) Continuity check (mesh-aware):
     - All expected cross-sections are determined from the known mesh spacing.
     - For each cross-section, it is verified whether at least one cell is 
     classified as material.
     - If any expected cross-section contains no material cells, the track is 
     considered non-continuous and no further analysis is performed.
     - The result is saved as a boolean file: "continuous.joblib".

  2) Per cross-section analysis (performed only if the track is continuous) – 
    two-stage workflow:

     Stage A — Row-level processing:
       - Each cross-section (x–z plane at fixed y) is processed row by row 
       (along the z-direction).
       - For each row, the total number of material cells, pore cells, and the 
       horizontal extent of material regions are recorded, among other 
       variables used in the subsequent analysis.
       - This information is collected for all rows across all cross-sections.

     Stage B — Metric computation:
       - Pores are classified as either:
         • Surface pores: located at the topmost layer of the cross-section.
         • Internal pores: located below the top surface layer.

       - **Width (W):**  
         Maximum horizontal extent of the melt pool within the cross-section.  
         If multiple disconnected material regions exist, the largest 
         horizontal span is used.

       - **Track height (H):**  
         Vertical extent of the melt pool, defined based on pore distribution:  
         • If surface pores are present: height = difference between the lowest
         material row and the row where the surface pore begins.  
         • If only internal pores are present (or none): height = difference 
         between the highest and lowest material rows.

       - **Depth (H_depth):**  
         Vertical distance between the lowest material row and the row where 
         the maximum horizontal width occurs (i.e., where the track width is
                                              largest).

       - **Porosity:**  
         Fraction of pore volume within the cross-section:  
         Porosity = number of pore cells / (number of pore cells + number of 
                                            material cells).  
         As cell volumes are uniform, this equals (pore volume / 
                                                   total cross-section volume).

     - Metrics are computed for all cross-sections and exported as a CSV file.

Outputs:
  - continuous.joblib          → Boolean indicating track continuity 
                                 (mesh-aware check).
  - cross_section_metrics.csv  → Per cross-section values of W, H, H_depth, and
  Porosity  (only if the track is continuous).
